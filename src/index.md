I'm <span id="text-name">Matt Buck</span>, a software engineer, entrepreneur, and technology educator living in Pittsburgh. I built <span id="text-voxable">[Voxable](https://voxable.io)</span>, spoke at SXSW, helped launch a coding bootcamp, and worked as a full-stack engineer for a number of software companies across my nearly two decades in the industry.
