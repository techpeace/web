# I build software & startups, with a focus on conversational & generative AI.

I'm a software engineer, entrepreneur, and technology educator. I built [Voxable](https://voxable.io), spoke at SXSW, helped launch a coding bootcamp, and worked as a full-stack engineer for a number of software companies across my nearly two decades in the industry.
